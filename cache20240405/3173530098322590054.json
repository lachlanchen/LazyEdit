    "prompt": "For words that have etymological Chu-Han alternative (due to their Sino-Vietnamese origin), I want to find the corresponding Chinese origin to replace the Viet WORDS (provide consecutive words if exist). However, it's crucial that the Viet in parenthesis followed by these traditional Chu-Han are put in brackets to maintain clarity. Like this example: (viet)[chuhan].\n\nVietnamese to be annotated: Tôi đang ăn.\n\nI don't need step by step explanation. PLEASE ONLY output the JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"viet_with_annotation\": \"\",\n  \"viet_chuhan_pairs\": [\n    {\n      \"viet_part\": \"\",\n      \"chuhan\": \"\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
