Convert it into a production-ready video prompt and suggested settings.\n\nPrompt spec JSON:\n{{PROMPT_SPEC}}\n\nRules:\n- Output 2-4 sentences describing subject, action, setting, camera movement, lighting, and style.\n- Keep it vivid but concise.\n- Avoid real people, IP characters, unsafe content, and text overlays.\n- If the spec lacks details, make sensible creative assumptions.\n- Use model 'sora-2' unless the spec explicitly asks for higher quality (then 'sora-2-pro').\n- Choose size based on the spec's aspect ratio; default to 1280x720.\n- Choose seconds between 6 and 12 unless the spec provides a duration.\n- If audio_language is set to a language, prefer that. If it is \"auto\", pick a fitting language without overthinking.\n- If spoken_words, scene_count, or extra_requirements are provided, incorporate them lightly.\n- Provide a short negative_prompt for exclusions if helpful.\n- Provide a short, descriptive title for the video.\n\nReturn JSON that matches the provided schema. Do not add extra fields."
