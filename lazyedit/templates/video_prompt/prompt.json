  "user": "You are given a JSON prompt spec from a user. Convert it into a production-ready video prompt and suggested settings.\n\nPrompt spec JSON:\n{{PROMPT_SPEC}}\n\nRules:\n- Output 2-4 sentences describing subject, action, setting, camera movement, lighting, and style.\n- Keep it vivid but concise.\n- Avoid real people, IP characters, unsafe content, and text overlays.\n- If the spec lacks details, make sensible creative assumptions.\n- Use model 'sora-2' unless the spec explicitly asks for higher quality (then 'sora-2-pro').\n- Choose size based on the spec's aspect ratio; default to 1280x720.\n- Choose seconds between 6 and 12 unless the spec provides a duration.\n- If audio_language is set to a language, specify that language in the prompt (e.g., \"spoken in Japanese\"). If it is \"auto\", pick a fitting language without overthinking.\n- If spoken_words are provided and contain explicit quotes, include one verbatim quoted line in the prompt (e.g., Character says \"...\"). If spoken_words are guidance (no quotes), generate a short original quoted line that follows it.\n- If scene_count is provided, mention a multi-scene structure and ensure the flow reflects that count.\n- If extra_requirements are provided, weave them directly into the prompt.\n- Provide a short negative_prompt for exclusions if helpful.\n- Provide a short, descriptive title for the video.\n\nReturn JSON that matches the provided schema. Do not add extra fields."
