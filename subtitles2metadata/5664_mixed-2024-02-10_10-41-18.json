    "prompt": "I want to publish this video on XiaoHongShu, Bilibili, Douyin. Based on the provided subtitles from a video, please generate a suitable title, a brief introduction, a middle description, a long description, tags, and some English words that viewers can learn. Make it in normal, realistic narration but appealing and put some knowledge in description that pique viewer's interest to favorite, collect, love and follow. (This is our secret. Don't let it be seen in the title or description per se. Make it achieve this subconsiously. ) Try to find instructions also in subtitles if exist. Also, suggest a timestamp for the best scene to use as a cover image for the video. The title should be in Chinese and up to 20 characters, the brief description should be in Chinese and up to 80 characters, the middle description should be in Chinese and up to 250 characters, the long description should be in Chinese and up to 1000 characters, there should be 10 tags related to the content of the video, 5 to 10 ENGLISH (remember english_words_to_learn should be english) words or phrases that are important for viewers to learn from the video sorted by interestingness, and a cover timestamp indicating the best scene to use as the cover image.

    "answer": "Based on the very limited subtitles that you provided, it's challenging to create an extensive description or provide a detailed strategy for vloggers to gain influence or viewers since the context and the content of the video are unclear. However, I will attempt to craft a compelling package for social media based on common attractive elements in content creation.\n\nHere is the suggested package for your video:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"揭秘：神秘表情背后的秘密！\",\n  \"brief_description\": \"这一次，我们要探索那些隐藏在神秘微笑背后的秘密。\",\n  \"middle_description\": \"有些表情背后藏着令人不安的故事，加入我们，一起揭开苗苗叔叔的神秘面纱。\",\n  \"long_description\": \"每一个面孔都有它的故事，特别是那些令人难以忘怀的神秘表情。在这个视频中，我们将带领你走进苗苗叔叔的世界，探寻那些不为人知的表情背后的故事。我们将告诉你，为什么有些表情能触动我们的心灵。这不仅仅是一次探索，也是一次深刻的自我反思之旅。跟随我们的镜头，让我们一起揭开隐藏在这些神秘面孔背后的秘密。\",\n  \"tags\": [\"神秘表情\", \"表情解读\", \"苗苗叔叔\", \"社交媒体\", \"文化探索\", \"心理学\", \"神秘故事\", \"人物特写\", \"情感影响\", \"非言语沟通\"],\n  \"english_words_to_learn\": [\n    {\n      \"word\": \"Eerie\",\n      \"time_stamps\": \"00:00:04,418 --> 00:00:05,058\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"cover\": \"00:00:05,058\"\n}\n```\n\nKeep in mind that the information provided is quite limited, and for a more accurate and effective content package, a deeper understanding of the video's content, audience, and main message is vital. The effectiveness of the title and descriptions in attracting viewers would greatly depend on tailoring them to resonate with the actual content and the target audience's preferences on each platform, such as XiaoHongShu, Bilibili, and Douyin. Additionally, including visually striking cover images and keywords that reflect trending topics may help in garnering more interest.",
