    "prompt": "I want to publish this video on XiaoHongShu, Bilibili, Douyin. Based on the provided subtitles from a video, please generate a suitable title, a brief introduction, a middle description, a long description, tags, and some English words that viewers can learn. Make it in normal, realistic narration but appealing and put some knowledge in description that pique viewer's interest to favorite, collect, love and follow. (This is our secret. Don't let it be seen in the title or description per se. Make it achieve this subconsiously. ) Try to find instructions also in subtitles if exist. Also, suggest a timestamp for the best scene to use as a cover image for the video. The title should be in Chinese and up to 20 characters, the brief description should be in Chinese and up to 80 characters, the middle description should be in Chinese and up to 250 characters, the long description should be in Chinese and up to 1000 characters, there should be 10 tags related to the content of the video, 5 to 10 ENGLISH (remember english_words_to_learn should be english) words or phrases that are important for viewers to learn from the video sorted by interestingness, and a cover timestamp indicating the best scene to use as the cover image. Each word should be accompanied by a time stamps range indicating when it appears in the video.\n\nEnglish subtitles:\n1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,400\n嗯\n\n2\n00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,560\n哎呀\n\n3\n00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,120\n不足超\n\n4\n00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:02,500\n我脱\n\n5\n00:00:04,418 --> 00:00:04,798\n .\n\n6\n00:00:05,058 --> 00:00:06,538\n苗苗叔叔不是要視頻嗎\n\n\n\nPlease write the output in the following format:\n{\n  \"title\": \"\",\n  \"brief_description\": \"\",\n  \"middle_description\": \"\",\n  \"long_description\": \"\",\n  \"tags\": [],\n  \"english_words_to_learn\": [\n    {\n      \"word\": \"\",\n      \"time_stamps\": \"HH:MM:SS,mmm --> HH:MM:SS,mmm\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"cover\": \"HH:MM:SS,mmm\"\n}",
    "answer": "Based on the very limited and fragmented English subtitles provided, it would be challenging to accurately infer the context, subject matter, or tone of the video. This limits the ability to create properly tailored titles, descriptions, and tags. Without content and context, any attempt to craft these elements would be purely speculative.\n\nHowever, I can construct a fictional scenario to illustrate how such elements might be constructed if the video were focused on, say, a vlogger (let's call him \"Uncle MiaoMiao\") encountering some humorous or unexpected situation. This is purely an example based on the text \"苗苗叔叔不是要視頻嗎,\" which suggests someone named Uncle MiaoMiao might be expected to take a video.\n\nHere's a constructed example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"苗苗叔叔的意外驚喜\",\n  \"brief_description\": \"一起來看苗苗叔叔如何面對這突如其來的情況吧！\",\n  \"middle_description\": \"當你以為一切都在控制之中時，總有些意外會讓你意想不到！加入苗苗叔叔，一起感受每一份驚喜！\",\n  \"long_description\": \"我們總以為生活中的小插曲不會給日常帶來太大影響，但苗苗叔叔的經歷告訴我們，有時候，這些小插曲正是生活的調味品。在這個視頻中，跟隨苗苗叔叔的腳步，看他如何在突發的小挑戰中尋找樂趣，學會適應和創造。不論你是在小紅書、Bilibili還是抖音，豐富的生活總是等你來探索。記得關注和喜歡，更多精彩內容不錯過！\",\n  \"tags\": [\"苗苗叔叔\", \"日常生活\", \"驚喜\", \"趣事\", \"適應\", \"樂趣\", \"生活挑戰\", \"視頻創作\", \"小紅書\", \"抖音\"],\n  \"english_words_to_learn\": [\n    {\n      \"word\": \"Unexpected\",\n      \"time_stamps\": \"00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,120\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"word\": \"Challenges\",\n      \"time_stamps\": \"00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:02,500\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"word\": \"Adapt\",\n      \"time_stamps\": \"00:00:04,418 --> 00:00:04,798\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"word\": \"Enthusiasm\",\n      \"time_stamps\": \"00:00:05,058 --> 00:00:06,538\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"cover\": \"00:00:06,538\"\n}\n```\n\nWithout the full video, the subjects it covers, or the specific content, crafting genuine descriptions is not feasible. The given timestamps of relevant words/phrases are likewise based on assumed context, as no English descriptions were present in the provided subtitles. \n\nPlease note that the output consists of placeholders and is concocted with the purpose of demonstrating the format rather than providing actual content. For an accurate and tailored approach, it's essential to review the full video content and develop a strategy based on that comprehensive understanding.",
