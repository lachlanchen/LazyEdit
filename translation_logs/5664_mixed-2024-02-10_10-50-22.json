For subtitles in any other language, keep the original text but also provide translations in both English and Chinese.\n\nSlightly correct some apparent speech recognition errorespecially homonym in both origin and its translation based on the context.\n\nProcess the following subtitles, ensuring translations are accurate and coherent, and format the output as shown in the example.
